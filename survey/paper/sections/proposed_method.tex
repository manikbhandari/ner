\section{Proposed Method}
\label{sec:proposed_method}
\method{} solves all three major challenges.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Using transfer learning, we avoid the problem of lack of a huge corpus for getting contextualized embeddings.
	\item We use additional low-level, syntactic tasks which provide low level supervision and force the model to learn syntactic information. This syntactic information like POS tags can be used by the model to predict Named Entities \cite{autoner} \reminder{Also cite POS paper}.
	\item We use distant supervision paradigm and use \textit{soft supervision} as described in AutoNER to allow our model to learn \textit{soft labels}.
\end{enumerate}
