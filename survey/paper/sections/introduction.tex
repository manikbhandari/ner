\subsection{Major Challenges}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Lack of corpus.
	\item Lack of supervised NER tags - you have to manually define the set of entities that you are interested in so this set will always be small. 
	\item Disambiguation - same surface form can mean two things in different context.
\end{enumerate}
